# SFMLResources
This project is where I learn how to implement resources in a game. Resources such as audio - music and sound effects, sprites like a spaceship and a background for the spaceship to fly over. Also added cmake support.

## Personal Notes:
This is fun. I'm learning SFML, C++ and Cmake. How cool is that?! :D
